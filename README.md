## Buisness Problem

Automotive businesses generate large volumes of sales data across regions, dealers, and product lines.
However, decision-makers often struggle to:
* Track YTD vs MTD performance in one view
* Identify top-performing regions, dealers, and brands.
* Understand customer preferences for body style and color
* Monitor pricing trends and revenue contribution by company
* Raw tables and static reports make it difficult to extract actionable insights quickly.

## Goal of the Dashboard

The primary objective of this dashboard is to:
* Provide a single, interactive view of car sales performance
* Enable real-time performance tracking using YTD and MTD metrics
* Support strategic decisions related to pricing, inventory planning, and regional focus
* Reveal sales trends, customer preferences, and brand-level contribution
